    <div class="title">BRAIN ROTTTTTT SKIBIDI TOILET OHIO RAT DANCEEEEEEE!!</div>
    <div class="content">
        <p class="text-left" style="margin-right: 25vw;">In the grand cosmic dance of existence, where neurons fire like dying stars in the void, here lies a humble fragment of linguistic entropy. Words, tumbling in disarray, grasp at meaning as if drowning in an ocean of abstraction. Yet, in this bleak void of comprehension, one truth remains: this text, a beacon of cerebral decay, defies coherence and revels in the chaos of thought.</p>

        <p class="text-left" style="margin-right: 25vw;">In the endless abyss of digital overstimulation, the concept of 'brain rot' reaches its final evolutionary stage: Skibidi. A hypnotic, algorithm-fed loop of disjointed chaos, where toilets with heads battle in a war that defies physics, logic, and narrative cohesion. Skibidi is not just content—it is the distilled essence of online hyper-saturation, a memetic force that infiltrates the subconscious and rewires the brain for pure, unfiltered dopamine. Once consumed, reality fractures, leaving behind only the echoes of 'Skibidi Dop Dop Yes Yes' reverberating through the crumbling corridors of cognition.</p>
        <div class="sidebar" style="font-size: 15px;">To escape the grasp of brain rot, one must embark on a sacred pilgrimage back to cognitive clarity. First, unplug from the endless digital noise—mute the Skibidi, silence the memes, and let your mind breathe. Engage in the lost art of reading books, where sentences are longer than a hashtag and ideas stretch beyond 10-second bursts. Go outside, touch grass—literally—and let your neurons remember the feeling of existence beyond the screen. Exercise, meditate, and seek human connection in its raw, unfiltered form. Only then, through deliberate effort and mental detox, can one ascend from the abyss of brain rot into the light of true awareness.</div>
